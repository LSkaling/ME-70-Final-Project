Stanford's ME 70 - Fluid Dynamics final project

Problem Statement

The project involves designing a space habitat, known as an O'Neill cylinder, with a unique set of characteristics and engineering challenges. The habitat is envisioned to resemble a long pill, and is designed to rotate in a manner that simulates Earth's gravity at its ends while allowing for zero-gravity conditions at its center. This rotational mechanism ensures that inhabitants experience a gravity gradient from the cylinder's ends to its midpoint, a realistic scenario for long term space flight, and interesting fluids problem to solve.

The cylinder is 50m long, and 3m in diameter. The water storage takes up 10 meters, as measured from the end of the cylindrical bulkhead. It will rotate about its center of gravity. Standard atmospheric pressure air fills the rest of the space, and the walls are made of â…› inch aluminum. A safety factor of 2 is required of all systems on this habitat. To ensure the structural integrity and functionality of this aquatic section, several engineering problems need to be addressed:

Emergency Water Ejection System: In case of an emergency that necessitates the rapid removal of water from the reservoir, a valve system must be designed to eject the water within 30 seconds. The challenge here is to calculate the size of the orifice or valve necessary to achieve this rapid ejection.

Valve strength: the valve must be able to withstand the pressure of the water when rotating at the nominal speed. Determining the amount	 of force the water will exert is critical. 

Impact on Rotation Speed Post-Water Ejection: The ejection of a significant mass of water from the cylinder could affect its rotation, potentially altering the artificial gravity generated within. The problem involves determining how the habitat's rotational speed will change after the water is ejected.
